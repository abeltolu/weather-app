# Weather App Challenge

### Installation
- `npm install`
- `npm run start:dev`
- To build for production, run `npm run build`

### Demo
- <a href="https://weatherappdhh.firebaseapp.com/">https://weatherappdhh.firebaseapp.com/</a>

### the task
implement a very basic weather service called "myWeather"

### expectations
- it does not have to be a perfectly working solution
- it should not take more than 4-5h
- consider the use case of mobile and/or tablet users
- nice design as a plus

### note
if the solution requires setup (starting a server or docker-container etc.), please leave an instruction

### stories
as a user of myWeather I want to see the forecast in the city of my choice

###### AC
- there is an input, where the user can type the name of the city
- the value of the input can be submitted to the "myWeater"-Service
- when the form is submitted, the user sees a list/row of tiles for the upcoming days
- a tile shows temperature, min/max limits, and condition
- the condition is displayed with an icon (see zip)
  - if the condition can not be matched with an icon, use the "sunny"-icon
- the min and max temperatures are displayed in the corners of the current temperature in a form comparable to superscript and subscript
- if the user did an error or there is no such city in myWeather service, he gets notified

### resources
